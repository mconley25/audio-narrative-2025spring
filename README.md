Welcome to Maddie's Repository! 
As someone who loves to travel, I wanted to create an audio narrative that captures the experience of traveling and the joy that comes with reaching the final destination. 
Sometimes, a travel day can be stressful, chaotic, and exhausting while other times it can be exciting, relaxing, and fun. 
Many flights I take are early in the morning, so I wanted to start the narrative off with the booming sound of an alarm and a big yawn.  
Then, I tried to imagine the small details that follow after rolling out of bed from zipping up your suitcase, to opening the door, to entering the elevator, to getting in the car, and finally arriving at the airport.
Once I arrive at the airport, I am always welcomed by a certain feeling. Some people are rushing off to a business trip while others are with their family going on vacation. 
Chatter fills the airport gates as announcements are made and tickets are scanned. Passengers are sipping on their coffee and rolling their luggage. 
Then, once you enter the plane, there is a sense of calmness and anticipation for the arrival. 
Some passengers listen to music to pass the time, some make small talk, some fall asleep.
Nothing compares to the feeling of being above the clouds and hovering over new places with a birds-eye view. 
When the plane arrives safely on the ground and the flight attendant announces your arrival, there is a feeling of excitement in the air and you can hardly wait to reach your destination. 
My dream destination is the beach. I love to hear the sound of waves crashing, the sun beaming on my skin, and tropical music playing. 
After a long day of travels, the beach is paradise and the best place for relaxation and happiness.
