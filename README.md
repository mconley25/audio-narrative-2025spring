Welcome to Maddie's repository
Updated list of assets preview stage: alarm clock recorded by Maddie, rolling and zipping luggage recorded by Maddie, door opening and closing recorded by Maddie. "Footsteps High Heels-Lobby Hall, walk and run" from Freesound by Vrymaa on September 5, 2024
In this preview from January 28, I am starting to record my own sounds for my audio narrative. I want to start off the narrative with an alarm clock waking me up. Then, I want to use sounds like walking, rolling luggae, and opening up the door to signal that we are leaving for the airport. While I did not layer any sounds, I was trying to download from audio from Freesound to combine with the sounds I recorded. I'm still working on learning how to use audacity and how to get my sounds to flow together. However, this preview practice has helped me brainstorm some assets I want to search for and other ones I can record myself. My next plans include capturing more audio while continuing to work on expanding my narrative and creating smooth transitions.
