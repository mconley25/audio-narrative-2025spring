Welcome to my preview file for the draft of my audio narrative! 

**Update (1/28)**

For the draft of my audio narrative, I have recorded my own sounds including my alarm, rolling luggae, opening/ closing the door, and zipping uo my suitcase. I also added in footstep sounds from FreeSound. I am trying to show the start of a travel day from the moment you wake up to the final destination. 

A few days after recording these sounds, my sister was coming home from a trip (perfect timing!). So, I asked her to capture some sounds from the airport for me to use! These sounds include scanning tickets, flight attendant announcements, and background chatter from the airport. 

Continuing on with the drafting process, I want to add more detailed sounds like the airplane taking off and arriving at the final destination. Since the destination is sunny Florida, I want my listeners to hear waves crashing, vibrant steel drums, and a soft voice saying "Welcome to Paradise." I also worked on playing with the volume of my audio especially when layering tracks to hear every sound. I also added cues like quick whoosh sounds and music to show a transition in location. So far, I have made great progress with the audio narrative and I'm excited to see teh final product!

**Update (2/5)**

I have just added my peers' feedback into my audio narrative. I specifically added more sounds earlier on (brushing teeth and pouring coffee) to make it clear that it was early in the morning. These sounds help set the scene a little bit better before leaving for the airport. I also added seagull noises at the very end just to add to the tropical vibe of the narrative. I plan to add a voiceover at the very end to note where listeners can find my credits in addition to listing them in my credits.md file.
